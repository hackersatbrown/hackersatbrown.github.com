## [Events in progress][1]
Event dictatorship goes on in the [issues page][1].
- make an [issue][1] for your event if it isn't already there
- assign yourself as dictator
- copy in the event TODO list:

        TODO: make better/longer
        - [âˆš] copied in event checklist
        - [ ] announced event to facebook, ugrad, etc
        - [ ] reserved room, made sure no conflicts
        - [ ] read over [how to host an event](https://github.com/hackersatbrown/hackersatbrown.github.com/wiki/How-to-host-an-event)
        - [ ] delegated to other people!
        - [ ] ?
- check off items as you do them and get it done! :)
- ask David/Charles/Rakesh for help as needed (just @mention them or email them)
