This is the code for the website.

## [Events in progress][1]
Event dictatorship goes on in the [issues page][1].
- make an [issue][1] for your event if it isn't already there
- assign yourself as dictator
- copy in the event TODO list:

        - [√] copied in event checklist
        - [ ] reserved room, made sure no conflicts        
        - [ ] announced event to [ ]facebook, [ ]ugrad åt lists.cs.brown.edu, [ ]morning mail
        - [ ] optional: made a poster or asked charles to make one for the event                
        - [ ] read over [how to host an event](https://github.com/hackersatbrown/hackersatbrown.github.com/wiki/How-to-host-an-event)                
        - [ ] delegated to other people!
        - [ ] ?

- check off items as you do them and get it done! :)
- ask Charles/Mackenzie for help as needed (just @mention them or email them)
- first-timers to event organization should sit down with Mackenzie/Charles 
  to run lightly through the checklist and get a feel for how it all works

## How to get involved in CS DUG
- start coming to meetings (announced on [FB group][2])
